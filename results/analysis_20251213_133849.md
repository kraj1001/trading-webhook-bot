## LLM Analysis (Mock Mode - No API Key Configured)

To enable real LLM analysis, set your API key in the .env file:
- OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
- or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

### Basic Pattern Analysis Available:

The system has collected detailed trade data including:
- Entry/exit indicators (CCI, RSI, MACD, Gold Line position)
- Market context (volatility, trend strength)
- Trade outcomes and durations

Once configured, the LLM will analyze this data to find:
1. Conditions that correlate with winning trades
2. Patterns that lead to losses
3. Specific parameter optimization suggestions
4. New filter recommendations

### Next Steps:
1. Add your LLM API key to .env
2. Run: python analyze_results.py
