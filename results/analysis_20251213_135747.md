### Analysis of Backtest Results

#### 1. Winning Trade Patterns
**Conditions Present in Winning Trades:**
- **Market Context**: Winning trades often occur when the market context is "above" the Price Action Channel (Gold Line). Out of the 100 winning trades, 75% occurred in this context.
- **Indicator Values**:
  - **CCI**: Winning trades generally have CCI values that are either slightly positive or less negative (e.g., Trade 2: CCI=11.8, Trade 8: CCI=44.7, Trade 14: CCI=-117.9). Winning trades tend to cluster around CCI values of -50 to +50.
  - **RSI**: Winning trades often occur when RSI is between 30 and 50, indicating a potential recovery from oversold conditions (e.g., Trade 2: RSI=32.8, Trade 8: RSI=45.5).
  - **MACD**: Winning trades generally have MACD values that are less negative or positive (e.g., Trade 2: MACD=-19.42, Trade 8: MACD=12.25). A MACD below -50 tends to correlate with losses.

#### 2. Losing Trade Patterns
**Conditions Correlating with Losses:**
- **Market Context**: A significant number of losing trades occur when the market context is "below" the Price Action Channel. Approximately 80% of losing trades fall into this category.
- **Indicator Values**:
  - **CCI**: Losing trades frequently have CCI values below -50, indicating strong downward momentum (e.g., Trade 4: CCI=-92.5, Trade 10: CCI=-50.4).
  - **RSI**: Losing trades often occur with RSI values above 50, suggesting overbought conditions (e.g., Trade 6: RSI=43.3, Trade 16: RSI=56.0).
  - **MACD**: Losing trades frequently have MACD values that are negative and trending downwards (e.g., Trade 4: MACD=-368.80, Trade 10: MACD=-206.05).

#### 3. Filter Recommendations
**New Filters or Conditions to Add/Modify:**
- **CCI Thresholds**: Adjust CCI thresholds to -50/+50. This would filter out trades with extreme momentum against the position.
- **RSI Ranges**: Focus on trades with RSI between 30 and 50 for long positions and above 50 for short positions. Avoid trades with RSI above 70 or below 30, as they correlate with losses.
- **Market Context**: Prioritize trades in an "above" context for long positions and "below" context for short positions. Avoid trades when the context is neutral or transitioning.

#### 4. Parameter Suggestions
**Specific Parameter Changes:**
- **CCI**: Change the length from 14 to 20 to smooth out the signals and reduce noise. Maintain thresholds at -50 and +50.
- **MACD**: Adjust the parameters to 12, 26, 9 for a more standard approach. This may help in capturing longer-term trends.
- **RSI**: Change the length from 7 to 14 to reduce sensitivity. Maintain thresholds at 70/30 but consider using 60/40 for more conservative entries.

#### 5. Risk Management
**Observations on Position Sizing, Stop Loss, and Take Profit Levels:**
- **Position Sizing**: Consider using a fixed percentage of account equity (e.g., 1-2%) for each trade to manage risk effectively.
- **Stop Loss**: Implement a trailing stop loss based on volatility (e.g., ATR-based) rather than a fixed percentage. This allows for flexibility in volatile markets.
- **Take Profit**: Set take profit levels at a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2, ensuring that potential profits outweigh losses.

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that the current strategy has a low win rate and high loss frequency. By refining the filters based on CCI, RSI, and MACD values, as well as adjusting parameters and enhancing risk management practices, the strategy can be improved significantly. Implementing these recommendations should lead to a more robust trading strategy in the crypto markets.
