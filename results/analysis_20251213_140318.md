### Analysis of Backtest Results

#### 1. Winning Trade Patterns
Based on the sample of winning trades, the following conditions were observed:

- **Market Context**: Winning trades often occurred when the market was trending downwards (indicated by a short position). For example:
  - Trade 2 (Short) had a MACD of -33.69, indicating a strong bearish trend.
  - Trade 8 (Short) had a MACD of -34.20, also confirming a bearish trend.

- **Indicator Values**: 
  - Winning trades tended to have lower CCI values (indicative of oversold conditions) or were in the negative range, suggesting a potential reversal.
  - For example, Trade 14 (Short) had a CCI of -107.6, indicating a strong bearish momentum.

- **Duration**: Winning trades generally had longer durations (e.g., Trade 2 lasted 15 candles), suggesting that allowing trades to run longer may capture more significant moves.

#### 2. Losing Trade Patterns
The analysis of losing trades revealed several patterns:

- **Market Context**: Many losing trades were initiated in a sideways or slightly bullish market context. For example:
  - Trade 4 (Loss) had a MACD of -893.72, indicating a weak bearish trend, yet the trade was long.
  - Trade 6 (Loss) had a MACD of -53.86, also suggesting a weak trend.

- **Indicator Values**: 
  - Losing trades often had CCI values that were either close to zero or positive, indicating a lack of momentum.
  - High RSI values (e.g., RSI > 50) were often present in losing trades, suggesting overbought conditions. 

- **Duration**: Many losing trades were short-lived, often lasting only a few candles, indicating that they were not given enough time to develop.

#### 3. Filter Recommendations
To improve the strategy, consider implementing the following filters:

- **CCI Thresholds**: Adjust the CCI threshold to focus on values below -50 for long positions and above 50 for short positions. This may help filter out trades that lack momentum.

- **RSI Ranges**: 
  - For long trades, consider only entering when RSI < 30 (oversold).
  - For short trades, consider entering when RSI > 70 (overbought).

- **Market Context**: 
  - Avoid entering long trades when MACD is negative or close to zero.
  - Focus on short trades when MACD is significantly negative (e.g., below -20).

- **Time of Day**: Analyze the time of day for trades. If certain hours consistently show lower win rates, consider avoiding those times.

#### 4. Parameter Suggestions
Based on the analysis, the following parameter adjustments are recommended:

- **CCI**: 
  - Current: 14 length, 75/-75 levels
  - Suggested: 14 length, -50/50 levels to better capture momentum.

- **MACD**: 
  - Current: 12, 17, 8
  - Suggested: 12, 26, 9 for a more standard MACD configuration, which may provide clearer trend signals.

- **RSI**: 
  - Current: 7 length, 70/30 levels
  - Suggested: 14 length, 70/30 levels to smooth out noise and provide more reliable overbought/oversold signals.

#### 5. Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Consider implementing a fixed percentage of capital per trade (e.g., 1-2%) to manage risk better. This can help mitigate losses during drawdowns.

- **Stop Loss**: Set a stop loss at a fixed percentage (e.g., 1% for short-term trades) or based on ATR (Average True Range) to account for volatility.

- **Take Profit**: Implement a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2. For example, if the stop loss is set at 1%, aim for a take profit of 2%.

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that the current strategy has a low win rate and could benefit from adjustments to indicator thresholds, market context filters, and risk management practices. By focusing on momentum and trend confirmation while avoiding trades in weak market conditions, the strategy's performance could be significantly improved.
