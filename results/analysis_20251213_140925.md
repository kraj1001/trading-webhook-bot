### Analysis of Backtest Results

#### 1. Winning Trade Patterns
**Conditions Present in Winning Trades:**
- **CCI Values:** Winning trades often have CCI values that are significantly negative for short trades (e.g., CCI = -128.5 for a winning short trade) and moderately positive for long trades (e.g., CCI = 39.4 for a winning long trade). Winning trades tend to occur when CCI is below -100 for shorts and between 0 and 100 for longs.
- **RSI Values:** Winning trades generally have RSI values below 60 for shorts (e.g., RSI = 39.3 for a winning short) and around 50-60 for longs (e.g., RSI = 54.3 for a winning long). This indicates that trades are taken when the market is not overbought.
- **MACD Values:** Winning trades show MACD values that are either slightly positive or negative but not extreme (e.g., MACD = 34.96 for a winning long).
- **Market Context:** Winning trades often occur in contexts of higher volatility (e.g., Volatility = 0.44% for a winning long trade). 

#### 2. Losing Trade Patterns
**Conditions Correlating with Losses:**
- **CCI Values:** Many losing trades have very high positive CCI values (e.g., CCI = 273.9 for a losing short trade) or very low negative values (e.g., CCI = -277.3 for a losing short trade). Avoid trades when CCI is above 100 for longs or below -100 for shorts.
- **RSI Values:** Losing trades frequently occur with RSI values above 70 (e.g., RSI = 76.9 for a losing long trade), indicating overbought conditions.
- **MACD Values:** Extreme MACD values (e.g., MACD = 450.11 for a losing long trade) correlate with losses. 
- **Market Context:** Losing trades often occur in low volatility contexts (e.g., Volatility = 0.14% for a losing short trade).

#### 3. Filter Recommendations
**New Filters/Conditions:**
- **CCI Threshold Adjustments:** 
  - **Long Trades:** Set a maximum CCI threshold of +100. 
  - **Short Trades:** Set a minimum CCI threshold of -100.
  
- **RSI Adjustments:**
  - **Long Trades:** Avoid trades when RSI > 60.
  - **Short Trades:** Avoid trades when RSI < 40.

- **Volatility Filter:** 
  - Only enter trades when volatility is above 0.25% to ensure sufficient market movement.

- **Time of Day:** 
  - Avoid trading during low-volume periods (e.g., early morning hours) and focus on times with higher volatility (e.g., market open and close).

#### 4. Parameter Suggestions
**Specific Parameter Changes:**
- **CCI:** 
  - **Current:** 14 length, 75/-75 levels.
  - **Suggested:** 14 length, adjust to 100/-100 levels for better filtering of extreme conditions.

- **MACD:** 
  - **Current:** 12, 17, 8.
  - **Suggested:** Maintain current settings, but consider adding a filter to avoid trades when MACD is above 100 or below -100.

- **RSI:** 
  - **Current:** 7 length, 70/30 levels.
  - **Suggested:** 14 length, adjust to 60/40 levels to capture more moderate overbought/oversold conditions.

#### 5. Risk Management Observations
**Position Sizing, Stop Loss, and Take Profit Levels:**
- **Stop Loss Levels:** Many losing trades hit stop losses quickly (e.g., durations of 10-20 candles). Consider implementing a trailing stop loss to lock in profits as trades move favorably.
- **Take Profit Levels:** The average win percentage (1.96%) is significantly higher than the average loss percentage (-1.07%). This indicates a favorable risk-reward ratio. However, consider increasing take profit levels to capture larger moves, especially in volatile conditions.
- **Position Sizing:** Given the win rate of 27.6%, consider adjusting position sizes based on the confidence level of the trade (e.g., increase size for trades meeting all criteria and decrease for those that do not).

### Summary of Recommendations
1. **Implement stricter CCI and RSI thresholds** to filter out extreme market conditions.
2. **Focus on higher volatility periods** for trade entries.
3. **Adjust parameters** for CCI, MACD, and RSI to improve signal quality.
4. **Enhance risk management** through trailing stops and adjusted position sizing based on trade confidence.

By applying these recommendations, the strategy should see improved performance and a higher win rate in future trading scenarios.
