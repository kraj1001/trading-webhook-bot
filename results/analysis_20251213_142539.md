### Analysis of Backtest Results

#### 1. Winning Trade Patterns
Based on the data, the following conditions are prevalent in winning trades:

- **CCI Values**: Winning trades often have CCI values that are either significantly negative (indicating oversold conditions) for short trades or positive for long trades. For example:
  - Winning short trades often have CCI values below -100 (e.g., Trade 2: CCI = -136.2).
  - Winning long trades typically have CCI values above 50 (e.g., Trade 3: CCI = 91.1).

- **RSI Values**: Winning trades generally have RSI values that are not excessively high (for long trades) or low (for short trades):
  - Long trades tend to have RSI values in the 50-70 range (e.g., Trade 3: RSI = 59.4).
  - Short trades often have RSI values below 40 (e.g., Trade 1: RSI = 39.3).

- **MACD Values**: Winning trades often show a positive MACD for long trades and a negative MACD for short trades:
  - Long trades have MACD values above 0 (e.g., Trade 3: MACD = 83.38).
  - Short trades have MACD values below 0 (e.g., Trade 1: MACD = -204.71).

- **Market Context**: Winning trades frequently occur in a "below" market context, indicating a bearish trend for shorts and bullish trend for longs.

#### 2. Losing Trade Patterns
The following conditions correlate with losing trades:

- **CCI Values**: Losing trades often have CCI values that are not extreme enough to indicate a strong trend reversal:
  - For example, Trade 4 (Loss) had CCI = 39.8, indicating a lack of momentum.

- **RSI Values**: Losing trades frequently have RSI values that are too high for long trades or too low for short trades:
  - Trade 12 (Loss) had RSI = 55.4, which is too close to neutral for a long entry.

- **MACD Values**: Losing trades often have MACD values that are either too close to zero or negative for long trades:
  - Trade 10 (Loss) had MACD = -105.28, indicating a bearish trend.

- **Market Context**: Losing trades often occur in a "above" market context, which may indicate a resistance level or overbought conditions.

#### 3. Filter Recommendations
To improve the strategy, consider the following modifications:

- **CCI Thresholds**: 
  - For long trades, set a CCI threshold of above 50 (instead of 75) to capture more potential winning trades.
  - For short trades, maintain a threshold below -100 to ensure strong momentum.

- **RSI Ranges**: 
  - For long trades, use an RSI range of 50-65 to avoid overbought conditions.
  - For short trades, consider an RSI threshold below 40 to confirm bearish momentum.

- **Avoid Certain Times/Conditions**: 
  - Avoid entering trades when volatility is high (above 2.5%) as it may lead to whipsaw effects.
  - Avoid trades when the market context is "above" for short entries.

#### 4. Parameter Suggestions
Based on the analysis, the following parameter changes are recommended:

- **CCI**: 
  - Adjust the length from 14 to 20 to smooth out the indicator and reduce false signals.
  - Set thresholds to 50/-100 (instead of 75/-75) to capture more relevant signals.

- **MACD**: 
  - Maintain the current settings (12, 17, 8) but consider adding a confirmation filter that requires the MACD line to be above the signal line for long trades and below for short trades.

- **RSI**: 
  - Change the length from 7 to 14 for better trend confirmation.
  - Adjust the levels to 65/40 to refine overbought/oversold conditions.

#### 5. Risk Management
Observations regarding risk management include:

- **Position Sizing**: Consider implementing a fixed percentage of account equity for each trade (e.g., 1-2% of total equity) to manage risk effectively.

- **Stop Loss**: 
  - Review stop-loss placement; consider using a trailing stop that adjusts based on volatility to lock in profits while allowing for potential upside.

- **Take Profit Levels**: 
  - Establish a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2 to ensure that winning trades compensate for losing trades effectively.

### Conclusion
By refining the entry conditions based on CCI, RSI, and MACD values, as well as implementing better risk management practices, the strategy can potentially improve its win rate and overall profitability.
